### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Jens - Software Engineer based in Germany. I am creating digital products which are web based and running in cloud environments. My focus is creating products which are easy to maintain, have a clean software architecture and are user oriented. Beside that I value requirements engineering and quality assurance over simply writing code to solve complex problems. 

I am active on LinkedIn and have my own personal toolbox (Software Engineering Toolbox).
